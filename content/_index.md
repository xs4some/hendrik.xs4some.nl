I’m a DevSecOps consultant passionate about open-source, privacy, and sustainable software infrastructure. With a strong foundation in GNU/Linux and hands-on experience across cloud platforms and CI/CD pipelines, I help organizations build secure, scalable, and efficient development environments.

At Xebia, I work with a wide range of clients—from aviation and healthcare to high-tech—guiding teams in adopting GitHub Enterprise, automating workflows, improving security posture, and reducing risk through smart policies and tooling.

I care deeply about digital sovereignty, support open-source initiatives, and believe that collaboration and pragmatism are key to making technology work for people.
